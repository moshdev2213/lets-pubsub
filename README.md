<!-- # üöÄ Google Pub/Sub Project

## üåü Overview

This is a small educatinal project demonstrates the use of **Google Cloud Pub/Sub** for asynchronous messaging between microservices, containerized using **Docker** and deployed on **Google Cloud Run**. The architecture includes:

- **Client App** (React): A web interface that triggers the message publishing process.
- **Order Service** (Express.js): Responsible for publishing messages to a Pub/Sub topic.
- **Notification Service** (Spring Boot): A subscriber that listens to the Pub/Sub topic and processes notifications.
- **Billing Service** (FastAPI): A subscriber that listens to the same Pub/Sub topic and handles billing tasks.

The project is integrated with **Google Cloud Artifact Registry** (GAR) for container storage, and **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

 # üì¶ Google Pub/Sub Project

<img width="1761" alt="gcp_pub_sub" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/468b4a3c-f4a9-40c7-b980-8c20811460d4">

This project demonstrates a **Google Pub/Sub** integration using a microservices architecture. It includes multiple services written in different languages‚Äî**Node.js (Express)**, **FastAPI**, and **Spring Boot**‚Äîall containerized and stored in **Google Artifact Registry (GAR)**. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) are handled via **GitHub Actions**.

---

## üìú Overview

The project contains the following services:

1. **Client Application (React)**
2. **Order Service (Node.js - Express)**
3. **Notification Service (Spring Boot)**
4. **Billing Service (FastAPI)**

### üåê Pub/Sub Architecture Flow:

1. The **Client App** triggers a message to be published by invoking an endpoint in the **Order Service**.
2. The **Order Service** (Node.js - Express) publishes the message to a Google Pub/Sub topic.
3. Two services are subscribed to this topic:
   - **Notification Service** (Spring Boot)
   - **Billing Service** (FastAPI)

The two subscribers handle the messages by performing different actions based on the published data.
